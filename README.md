# Create you own AI art 

<br>

## App overview

Ai is the hottest trend in tech right now. I built a python app that uses the OpenAI api to generate images based on user prompts. Streamlit is a nice <br>
framework that gets your app running and be able to share instantly. However, in the future I might use a better/mature web framework for this application like Django or Node.js in order to add some cool features and better styling.
